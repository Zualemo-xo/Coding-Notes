## Inspiration

DSA is one of the skill that you need to practise a lot and almost all companies have a coding round. So it's really important to get to grips with DSA.
So, we thought of sharing almost all the codes we went through to give you folks a headstart or even to be used as a revision kit. It's important to get hold of coding skills to clear the placement rounds! And this repo will definetely help you get started.

## Description

We have pushed all Java and CPP codes into respective folder. Additionally we also have a notes folder for some really informative and cool handwritten notes and concepts about DSA. You can use it as last minute revision notes too!

## What's next

We would be updating the codes and notes and also the reasoning section as we go along. Need your love and support to progress more! Hope it helps y'all.
